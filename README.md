# Deep Learning
Various Deep Learning projects is something I absolutely enjoy doing. 
Here are a new codes :

- BERT Model for sentiment analysis of Google Play Store Reviews (with 89% test accuracy)
- Deep Convolutional GAN trained on MNIST Fashion data to generate realistic-looking (but fake) images of clothing
- Neural Network Classifier to determine which instrument is playing (e.g. trumpet, violin, piano) with 99% accuracy 
- Tic Tac Toe game played between an agent which used random strategy and another which uses Q-learning strategy
